These are projects i completed while pursuing my Masters of Science in Data Science

## Visualizing Uncertainity in Weekly Fantasy Football Projections

My final project for my data visualization course creates a dashboard to visualize the uncertainity in specific weekly players fantasy point projections. 
The dashboard analyzes the weekly expert projections on Fantasy Pros to visualize the uncertainity in the statistical projections in terms of fantasy football points.
Each performance statistic is modeled with a truncated normal distribution, truncated based on the low and high predicted values for each stat. Built into the predictions and therefore the assumptions for this tool are that a player plays the whole game without injury.

## Modeling MPG of 1970's Cars

The analysis and resulting model created for the fuel efficiency of 1970's cars was created as a project for my Data Science Class.

## Spam Email Classification

For our final project, my team selected a dataset and created a model from it to answer a question that the dataset could illuminate. We used a dataset of spam emails and attempted to create a spam email classifier.
I was the group leader for this project.

## Learning Scoring Systems with Deep ReLu Networks

My semester long research project for advanced machine learning is the paper "Learning Scoring Systems with Deep ReLu Networks". The paper and code sufficent to duplicate the experiments is included.
